# Todo Li
## Get it down. 
## Get it done.

## Description

Originally a todo list application centered around the integration of a database with the utilization of CRUD. Extended with the addition of authentication, private routing and a personal calendar feature.  I enjoyed coding the calendar, it was fun to useState and date functions in a direct and practical manner.
